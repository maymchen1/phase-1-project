# Online Resell Shop

### Overview
For my phase 1 project, I created a simplistic resell website using html and javascript. 
### Features
The website features 3 pages: a homepage, a wishlist page, and a sell page. The homepage is the page that greets users when they first enter the website. The wishlist page features a sample collection of items that a user may add to their wishlist. The sell page is where users can go and add their own clothing listings to publish onto the website. 
### How to use
The website uses simple user mechanics. To load the homepage, the user can simply click on the site title on the upper lefthand corner. To view their wishlist, the user can click on "wishlist." To add items to sell, the user must populate a form with item name, size and price before submitting.
