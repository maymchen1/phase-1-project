# Online Resell Shop

### Overview
For my phase 1 project, I created a simplistic resell website using html and javascript. 
### Features
The website features 3 pages: a homepage, a wishlist page, and a sell page. The homepage is the page that greets users when they first enter the website. The wishlist page features a sample collection of items that a user may add to their wishlist. The sell page is where users can go and add their own clothing listings to publish onto the website.
